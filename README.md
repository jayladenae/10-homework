# Team Profile Generator 

## Description 

This is a  a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

### Usage

1. Right click index.js and open the Integrated Terminal.

2. On the command line run the code `node index.js`

3. You will then be prompted with a series of questions about your team!

4. Once you are done answering your questions you will see a message that states    "Congratulations, you have successfully created a webpage for your team!". Once you see this message you can look to the left and see a new theTeam.html was created.

5. You can now open your theTeam.html in your browser and see a summary for each employee on your team!
